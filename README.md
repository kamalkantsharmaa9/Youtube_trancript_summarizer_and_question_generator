# Youtube_trancript_summarizer_and_question_generator

Motivation(why do we have to do it? What are the motivating examples ? What are potential gains ? ):
Enormous number of video recordings are being created and shared on the Internet throughout the day.It has become really difficult to spend time watching such videos which may have a longer duration than expected and sometimes our efforts may become futile if we couldn't find relevant information out of it. Summarizing transcripts of such videos automatically allows us to quickly look out for the important patterns in the video and helps us to save time and effort to go through the whole content of the video. And then we can use a question generator on that so we can generate some quality questions on it.Which will be helpful to both creator of the video to show how much quality of video he/she is delivering and for consumer also to take the whole crux out of it and can ask such a good quality of question.
